## üìù Description

Etherskan (with a K) is an application based off of Etherscan.io. In this application, the user can view the latest blocks and transactions, as well as search a block or transaction in the Ethereum network to view its details.

This is my first project related to the blockchain so I am excited to continue learning about this topic and become a part of this community.
